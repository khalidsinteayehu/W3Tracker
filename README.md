# W3Tracker - Web3 Task Guardian üõ°Ô∏è

![W3Tracker Interface](screenshot.png)

**My personal fortress against missed airdrops and lost opportunities**  
*"Built after losing $2,300 in potential earnings from simple oversights"* - Khalid Sinteayehu

## üî• Why This Exists

As a Web3 power user, I was constantly:
- Losing track of 20+ concurrent airdrop campaigns
- Missing critical deadlines (cost me $800+ in one month)
- Forgetting daily check-ins (destroying 30-day streaks)
- Losing credentials in Discord/Twitter chaos
- Wasting hours tracking tasks in spreadsheets

## ü¶∏ How W3Tracker Saves You

### Never Lose Value Again
- **Deadline Alerts**: Visual warnings 3 days before cutoff
- **Activity Lock**: Daily check-ins with blockchain-style confirmations
- **Credential Vault**: Secure storage for all access keys

### Battle-Tested Features
```javascript
// Real functionality I use daily:
function checkDailyQuests() {
  return projects.filter(p => 
    p.status === 'ACTIVE' && 
    !p.lastCheckin.includes(new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0])
  );
}
```

## üöÄ Core Features

*No node_modules, no deployments, no nonsense*

## üåü Pro Tips From My Experience

1. **Naming Convention**:  
   `[Chain]_[Project]_v2` e.g., `ARB_Starknet_v2`  
   *(saved me from 3 duplicate entries)*

2. **Backup Script**:
```javascript
// Run in console weekly
localStorage.setItem('W3Tracker_Backup_'+new Date().getTime(), 
  JSON.stringify(localStorage));
```
